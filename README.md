A 3-Axis CNC engraving machine is a computer-controlled device capable of performing three-dimensional engraving, carving, and cutting tasks using graphical interface.
Introduction About CNC:
Computer numerical control (CNC) is a type of Numerical Control system in which a computer 
is embedded into the control to carry out operations. CNC machines combine several tools, 
such as drills and milling tools, and employ CAD/CAM applications to generate a computer 
file that is processed to extract machine commands. The procedure is highly automated and 
results in a component that is nearly identical to the original CAD design. When compared to 
manual or mechanically controlled operations, CNC technology enhances productivity and 
precision in repeated manufacturing.
PCBs are an essential component of electronics, appearing in circuits ranging from basic to 
high-end. They are narrow boards with copper rails that link at nodes where components are 
connected to connect them electrically. The method of designing on a hard surface by cutting 
grooves is known as engraving. CNC machines are extensively used in industries, and miniCNC machines for PCB drawing and drilling may be developed using a low-cost system by 
combining PC and ATMEGA 328 controller characteristics in an Arduino. The system employs 
G code, a programming language that instructs machine tools on how to construct something.
In CNC, a microprocessor is utilized to interpret logical instructions from a computer, which 
might be in the form of code, text, or an image. The microprocessor converts these instructions 
into machine language, which the machine may then execute.
1.2 OBJECTIVE
The main Objective of our project is to develop and manufacture a CNC machine that offers 
high precision and automation capabilities while minimizing costs. The project would focus on 
optimizing the design, materials, manufacturing processes, and software integration to achieve 
the following objectives:
1. Affordability: The primary goal is to create a CNC machine that is cost-effective to 
manufacture, making it more accessible to a wider range of users. This involvesselecting economical components, efficient manufacturing techniques, and minimizing 
unnecessary features that could drive up costs.
2. Precision and Performance: While emphasizing cost-effectiveness, the project should 
strive to maintain high levels of precision and performance. The CNC machine should 
be capable of accurately executing complex machining operations, ensuring consistent 
and reliable results.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The CNC machine should have an intuitive and user-friendly 
interface that simplifies programming, setup, and operation. 
4. Integration with Industry Standards: The smart CNC machine project should aim to 
integrate with existing industry standards and software platforms. This allows for 
seamless compatibility and collaboration with other machines, tools, and software 
systems commonly used in manufacturing environments.
5. Energy Efficiency: The project should prioritize energy-efficient design and operation, 
incorporating features such as low-power consumption components, intelligent power 
management. This contributes to reducing operational costs and environmental impact.
6. Scalability and Modularity: The CNC machine design should be scalable and modular, 
allowing for customization and future upgrades. This enables users to adapt the machine 
to their specific needs and incorporate new technologies as they become available 
without the need for complete replacement.
